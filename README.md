## About

eszFW is a cross-platform game development framework written in C99.
It's mainly aimed at platformer games, but can be used and customized
for any other genre.  Furthermore, this project is the logical
continuation of my older projects [Rainbow
Joe](https://github.com/mupfelofen-de/rainbow-joe) and [Boondock
Sam](https://github.com/mupfelofen-de/boondock-sam).

It is written in C99 using SDL2 and the [TMX Map
Format](http://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/tmx-map-format/)
(Tile Map XML).

## Documentation

### Status

This project is in development.  I will enhance it gradually, mainly as
a tool to my own use.  To see it in action, take a look at [Tau
Ceti](https://github.com/mupfelofen-de/TauCeti): a cross-platform 2D
sci-fi themed tech demo which I develop to test this framework.

An Android version of Tau Ceti is available on Google Play:

### Trivia

The abbreviation esz is a tribute to my best friend [Ertugrul
SÃ¶ylemez](https://github.com/esoeylemez), who suddenly passed away on
May 12th 2018.  We all miss you deeply.

## Why C?

A question I hear alot is why I'm using C99 for this project instead of
a modern language like Rust, Haskell or `[insert your preferred language
here]`, because writing games in C99 is neither a easy thing to do nor
very common these days (even though many popular and critical acclaimed
games are written in C e.g. Doom, Quake and Neverwinter Nights).

The main reason is simple: because I love it.  Even though I am
currently trying to get on with Haskell, I still consider C a fun and
challenging language which I also use professionally.

Anyway: I hope you find the code of this project useful.  If so, feel
free to use it in any way you want. Just consider buying me a beer in
case we meet someday.
